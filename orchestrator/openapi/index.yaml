    API for SpecFlux - AI-Powered Multi-Repo Development Orchestrator.

    SpecFlux orchestrates Claude Code agents across multiple repositories
    with spec-driven workflows and configurable pipelines.

    ## API Conventions

    - All responses use a consistent envelope: `{ success: boolean, data?: T, error?: Error }`
    - List endpoints support pagination via `page` and `limit` query parameters
    - PATCH is used for partial updates, PUT for full resource replacement
    - 204 No Content is returned for successful DELETE operations
    - Error responses include machine-readable codes and human-readable messages

    ## Status Codes

    - 200: Success
    - 201: Created
    - 204: No Content (successful DELETE)
    - 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
    - 401: Unauthorized
    - 404: Not Found
    - 409: Conflict (state conflicts, duplicate resources)
    - 500: Internal Server Error
